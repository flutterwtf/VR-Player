## Getting Started

Based on Kaltura Playkit SDK:
  * [Android](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android)
  * [IOS](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-ios)

The `VrPlayer` plugin lets you play 360Â° and VR videos smoothly on Android and iOS platforms, delivering an immersive viewing experience with touch and device motion controls. These types of videos, commonly referred to as immersive, 360, or spherical videos, are captured by utilizing an omnidirectional camera or multiple cameras to record the entire panoramic view simultaneously.
## Usage

```dart
VrPlayer(
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  onCreated: onViewPlayerCreated,
  width: playerWidth,
  height: playerHeight,
),
```
You should implement `onViewPlayerCreated` to receive player events.

```dart
void onViewPlayerCreated(
  VrPlayerController controller,
  VrPlayerObserver observer,
) {
  _viewPlayerController = controller;
  observer
    ..onStateChange = onReceiveState
    ..onDurationChange = onReceiveDuration
    ..onPositionChange = onChangePosition
    ..onFinishedChange = onReceiveEnded;
  _viewPlayerController.loadVideo(
    videoUrl:
        'https://cdn.bitmovin.com/content/assets/playhouse-vr/m3u8s/105560.m3u8',
  );
}
```

### VrPlayerController

The `VrPlayerController` can be used to change the state of a `VrPlayer`. Note that the methods can only be used after the `VrPlayer` has been created.

 Method | Description 
--- | ---
`loadVideo({String? videoUrl, String? videoPath})` | Initializes video based on configuration. Invoke actions which need to be run on player start. Pass `videoPath` to load local files, or `videoUrl` to play files from network. *Local files supports only Android.*
`isPlaying()` | Check current player state.
`play()` | Play video.
`pause()` | Pause video.
`seekTo()` | Seek to position.
`setVolume()` | Set video volume level from 0 (no sound) to 1 (max).
`fullScreen()` | *(Android only)* Enable/disable fullscreen mode.  On IOS  you need to pass new width and height to VrPlayer widget
`toggleVRMode()` | Switch between 360Â° mode and VR mode. 
`onSizeChanged()` | *(Android only)* Reload player when you need to change size of nativeView.
`onPause()` | *(Android only)* Dispose player on pause.
`onResume()` | *(Android only)* Reload player.
`onOrientationChanged()` | *(Android only)* Notily player when orientation changed.

### Local Files Guide *(Android only)*

Working with video from storage is a bit difficult than from the Internet. Follow the instructions bellow to launch local files correctly.

1. Add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>` to the file `AndroidmManifest.xml`.
2. Request permission to read external storage from user.
3. Call `loadVideo()` with correct `videoPath`.
